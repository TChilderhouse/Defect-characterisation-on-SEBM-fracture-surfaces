This GitHub repository contains the Matlab files used to plot the spatial distributions of unmelted powder particles found on images of SEBM fatigue specimen fracture surfaces  presented in the article titled: "The influence of finish machining depth and hot isostatic pressing on defect distribution and fatigue behaviour of selective electron beam melted Ti-6Al-4V". 

The script included can be used for post-processing the BW data files generated using Matlabs Find circles function in the segmentImage imageSegmenter app used to locate individual unmelted powder particles on the fractograph images.
